Accuracy-based Classifier Systems for Python 3

This xcs submodule provides a version of the BitString class, implemented
using ordinary Python ints. Speed is comparable to numpy arrays.

Do not access the contents of this module directly. See the documentation
for xcs.bitstrings for a detailed explanation of how to properly access
the appropriate BitString implementation.

    Init Arguments:
        bits: An int or a sequence of bools which is used to determine the
            values of the bits in the BitString.
        length: An int indicating the expected length of the BitString, or
            None. Default is None, which causes the length of bits to be
            used if it is a sequence, or bits.bit_length() if bits is an
            int.

    NOTE: If the bits argument is an int, length must be None or an int
          of length >= bits.bit_length(). If bits is a sequence of bools,
          then the length of the sequence must exactly equal length. If
          these length constraints are not met, a ValueError is raised.
