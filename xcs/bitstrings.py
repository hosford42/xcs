Accuracy-based Classifier Systems for Python 3

This xcs submodule provides bit-string and bit-condition data types used by
the XCS algorithm.

Pure Python versus numpy:
    This submodule has two alternate implementations for the BitString
    class. One is based on Python ints, has no external dependencies, and
    is used by default. The other is based on numpy arrays, requires numpy
    to be installed, and can be activated by calling use_numpy(). If you
    change your mind, you can always switch back to the pure Python
    implementation by calling use_pure_python(). If you're not sure which
    one you're using, you can tell by calling using_numpy(). Before you
    call use_numpy(), it is recommended that you verify that numpy is
    available by calling numpy_is_available() to avoid an import error.
    While it is safe to switch back and forth between implementations as
    many times as you like, you must not mix BitString or BitCondition
    instances from one implementation with those of the other; to do so may
    lead to undefined behavior.

    It is worth noting that the Python int-based and numpy array-based
    implementations have (somewhat surprisingly) roughly comparable speeds.
    In fact, on some systems, the Python-based implementation is visibly
    faster. If you are concerned with speed, it is best to actually test
    the two implementations on your system to see which is faster. If not,
    the pure Python implementation, enabled by default, is recommended.

    indicating the bit mask, which together act as a matching template for
    bit strings. Like bit strings, bit conditions are hashable and
    immutable. Think of BitConditions as patterns which can match against
    BitStrings of the same length. At each index, we can have a 1, a 0, or
    a # (wildcard). If the value is 1 or 0, the BitString must have the
    same value at that index. If the value is #, the BitString can have any
    value at that index.

    BitConditions are matched against BitStrings in one of two ways:
        Method 1:
            result = condition // bitstring
            # result now contains a new BitString which contains a 1 for
            # each position that violated the pattern, and a 0 for each
            # position that did not. This tells us exactly where the
            # condition and the bitstring disagree
        Method 2:
            result = condition(bitstring)
            # result now contains a single Boolean value which is True if
            # the bitstring fully satisfies the pattern specified by the
            # condition, or False if the bitstring disagrees with the
            # condition at at least one index

    BitConditions can also match against other BitConditions in the same
    way that they are matched against BitStrings, with the sole exception
    that if the condition being used as the pattern specifies a 1 or 0 at a
    particular index, and the condition being used as the substrate
    contains an # at that point, the match fails. This means that if
    you have two conditions, condition1 and condition2, where condition1
    matches a bitstring and condition2 matches condition1, then condition2
    is guaranteed to match the bitstring, as well.
