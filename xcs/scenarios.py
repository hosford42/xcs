"""
Accuracy-based Classifier Systems for Python 3

This xcs submodule provides the scenario interface and a selection of
predefined scenarios and wrappers. Most widely used machine learning
algorithms operate on static, non-interactive data sets which have already
been collected, building a model from one data set and then using that
model to assess a new data set drawn from the same data source, predicting
unknown values from known ones. Unlike other machine learning algorithms,
reinforcement learning algorithms, of which XCS is one example, are capable
of dealing with not only non-interactive data, but interactive processes in
which classification decisions must be made on the fly that can potentially
affect which data will be gathered and classified in the future.

As a consequence, training a reinforcement learning algorithm such as XCS
is not always as simple as gathering a lot of data into a table or file and
then running the algorithm to build a model. The interactivity between the
algorithm and the environment from which the data is being collected must
be accounted for; this is the role of the Scenario class. The Scenario
class is an abstract base class that is designed to provide a standardized
interface through which reinforcement learning algorithms can assess the
environment and act upon it, building up models as they proceed.

If you wish to create a scenario of your own, subclass the Scenario class
and define the appropriate methods. To add logging to an existing scenario,
wrap your scenario in a ScenarioObserver. To treat non-interactive, pre-
collected data as a scenario, use PreClassifiedData for training and
testing, or UnclassifiedData for prediction. To get a full listing of the
classes provided by this module and see documentation on their appropriate
usage, use "help(xcs.scenarios)".
