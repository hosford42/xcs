Description
-----------

XCS is a Python 3 implementation of the XCS algorithm as described in
the 2001 paper, `An Algorithmic Description of
XCS <http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44640-0_15>`__, by
`Martin
Butz <http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/cognitive-modeling/staff/staff/martin-v-butz.html>`__
and `Stewart Wilson <http://prediction-dynamics.com/>`__. XCS is a type
of `Learning Classifier System
(LCS) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_classifier_system>`__, a
`machine learning <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`__
algorithm that utilizes a `genetic
algorithm <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm>`__ acting on
a rule-based system, to solve a `reinforcement
learning <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning>`__
problem.

In its canonical form, XCS accepts a fixed-width string of bits as its
input, and attempts to select the best action from a predetermined list
of choices using an evolving set of rules that match inputs and offer
appropriate suggestions. It then receives a reward signal indicating the
quality of its decision, which it uses to adjust the rule set that was
used to make the decision. This process is subsequently repeated,
allowing the algorithm to evaluate the changes it has already made and
further refine the rule set.

A key feature of XCS is that, unlike many other machine learning
algorithms, it not only learns the optimal input/output mapping, but
also produces a minimal set of rules for describing that mapping. This
is a big advantage over other learning algorithms such as `neural
networks <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network>`__
whose models are largely opaque to human analysis, making XCS an
important tool in any data scientist’s tool belt.

The XCS library provides not only an implementation of the standard XCS
algorithm, but a set of interfaces which together constitute a framework
for implementing and experimenting with other LCS variants. Future plans
for the XCS library include continued expansion of the tool set with
additional algorithms, and refinement of the interface to support
reinforcement learning algorithms in general.
